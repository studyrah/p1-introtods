List of references to material used to answer the problem sets/short q's

[src]

There is a directory for each problem set 1 - 5, these are called respectively:

ps1-problemsets
ps2-problemsets
ps3-problemsets
ps4-problemsets
ps5-problemsets

Within each directory there is (typically) 1 .py file per problem within the
problem set, filenames start 'pn-' where n is the problem number and are
followed by a descriptive title relevant to the problem:

(e.g.

ps2-problemsets
      |
      |--- p1-numrainydays.py
      |--- p2-fogtemperaturedays.py
      |--- p3-meanweekendtemperature.py
      |--- p4-meantemponrainydays.py
      |--- ...etc.
)

Each directory also contains additional files (e.g. datasets, graph output)
relevant to the problem set.

NOTE: there are also analogous directories for the coding exercises within
the lectures
